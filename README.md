# Hi, I’m 👋 Full Stack Developer

I’m a self-taught **Full Stack Developer** focused on building reliable and scalable web applications using the **MERN stack**. I work across both frontend and backend, with an emphasis on clean architecture, maintainable code, and practical problem-solving.

I learn by building real projects, reading documentation, and improving systems step by step. I’m comfortable adapting to new tools and workflows and enjoy working on end-to-end application development.
